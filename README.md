# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A **content-based movie recommender system** built with Python and Streamlit that suggests movies based on their plot summaries. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization**, **cosine similarity**, and **TMDB API** to fetch movie posters — all served through an elegant web interface.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [movie-recommendationn.streamlit.app](https://movie-recommendationn.streamlit.app/)

When a user selects a movie (e.g., **"The Dark Knight"**), the system recommends:

- *Batman Begins*
- *The Dark Knight Rises*
- *Iron Man*
- *Man of Steel*
- *Avengers: Infinity War*

...along with their respective posters, fetched dynamically from TMDB.
